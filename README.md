# 4-Msc-Coding-2-Week(7)

CCI-CC-S2-In-class exercise by Heying Wang

## Intro 

  This exercise focus on using TensorFlow to create outputs

## Technology used for implementation

 ##### Neural style transfer
  
  This is implemented by optimizing the output image to match the content statistics of the content image and the style statistics of the style reference image. These statistics are extracted from the images using a convolutional network.
 

## Design Process
   Import and configure modules->Visualize the input->**trying Fast Style Transfer using TF-Hub ** ->

## Further improvement

  I would like to add something like seagulls and more complex walking stuff, such as the ones in the movie Soul.
